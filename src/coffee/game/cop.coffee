      Dentley thumbs the stack of bills to make sure you aren't shorting him. "Horace Brown, eh?
      Funny you should mention him. That name just came across my desk this morning."

      You ask whether this means the police are going to investigate the disappearance after all.

      "No, no, nothing like that. His _alleged_ disappearanceâ€¦" Something gives even Dentley pause.
      "That investigation is being shut down from a very high level. No, he came up as a person of
      interest in another case. Of course, as no one can find him, that's a request I am putting
      no effort into fulfilling."

      "There was a body. Washed up on the south banks near the granary district. It also vanished
      before we could bring it in. I don't know any more than that, but someone thinks it's tied to
      Brown, somehow, so it's probably of interest to you."

      You burst into the warehouse and order everyone on the floor. Like terrified lambs, they all
      comply. Despite their sick tendencies, these men and women aren't savage or prepared to
      defend themselves. They're lucky you found them and their crime first; the police might
      have come in with guns blazing.

      They're "ghouls," or at least that's how they fancy themselves. People who think this era of
      casual magic gives them the right to appropriate old cultural traditions and use them as a
      cover for their twisted desires.

      You gather what's left of the body in a sack and warn them to get lost before the police
      arrive. You make haste to the precinct before the body starts to smell, but not before taking
      a peek for yourself.

      There's not much left, but what's there is confusing. The body is female, unqestionably.
      There are bits of clothing from a dress similar to the one
      Mrs. Brown was wearing the day she walked into your office. Also a broach that's identical
      to one you've seen at the Brown household. And judging by the time of its discovery and its
      state at the time, this person probably died within a day before or after Mr. Brown
      disappearing. There's no hope of identifying this person now, but
      this is definitely tied to your case somehow.
