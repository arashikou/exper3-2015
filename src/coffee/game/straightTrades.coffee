      There's always work to be had for someone with your particular talents. It's not always
      _good_ work, but it pays.

      Of course, it takes money to make money. Or in your case, it takes hunches. If you're all
      tapped out, you may just have to come back tomorrow.

      You spend a few hours pointing out crates that have been magically modified and bills of
      lading that have been magically forged. The foreman can't afford to pay you, but you wave
      him off. You got more than your money's worth in gossip from the dockworkers.

      Along with moving furniture, you helpfully point out which objects have been carelessly
      transmuted or obscured. With any luck, the landlord will never realize how much this place
      resembled a magical strip club in a junk heap this morning. Being poor students, they can only
      pay in leftovers from last night, but it's worth the effort.

      You gently break the news. This one is fake. That one is real. The large one in the back? It
      never existed at all. The antiquarian, forseeing lean times in his future, can only offer a

      You find the work of a few overnight vandals, including some really impressive choreographed

      It's the dryest possible work, just sitting there watching all parties in a negotiation

      of your presence is essential. And you pick up plentiful info from the deals you overhear.

      Most people pass muster, but you do have to stop a few for additional investigation. One
      appears to be genuinely unaware of her predicament and is sent off for disenchanting. Another
      is apparently into some very unorthodox uses of spellwork in the bedroom and
      forgot to clean everything off himself afterwards. He is likewise sent off for disenchanting.
