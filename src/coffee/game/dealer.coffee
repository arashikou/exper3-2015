      You can't even open your mouth before the rarities dealer recognizes you for what you are.
      "How the hell did you even get in here, you burnout!? Where's security?"

      Before he can summon anyone, you slam the demon cage down on the table. It shuts him right
      up. At his quizzical stare, you produce the demon's papers. He looks them over, then looks
      them over again, unable to believe that someone as mundane as yourself could get your
      hands on such an esoteric item.

      Finally, he grunts his assent. "I'll concede, you are something special. I don't have any use
      for it, but I'll put it up for sale. If anyone wants the little bastard, you get 50% after
      taxes.
      And if you're interested in making any other trades, why not come by my shop later yourself?"
      He produces a card with an address and a password.
