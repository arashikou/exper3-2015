      Downing an entire case of Cantrip-Up won't restore your magic in any way, but it will give you
      enough of a glow to trick the bouncer into letting you in.

      Once inside, you take up a position in the corner closest to the kitchen and watch the
      crowd. There are countless magical types in here, but do any catch your eye?
